// "on demand" overnight needs no query re-run and no cache flush. The daily
// refresh is free.

// SCOPE BOUNDARY: this recommends, it never assigns. "Assign an ASE" is wording
// shown to the AE/SE. Nothing is written back to Elementum, Salesforce, or the
// Bluebird allow-list — those are all read-only replicas or manual gates.
