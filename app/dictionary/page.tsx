          The suggestions on this app are <strong>starting points</strong>, not instructions.
          They surface uncovered Cap1 accounts and recommend a next action based on deal size,
          consumption stage, and partner signals. <strong>If you see a clear need to assign an
          ASE, go ahead — don't wait for the app to tell you.</strong> Use your own judgment
          and knowledge of the account first.
